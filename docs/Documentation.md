# Monitoring service
Redis/in-memory database monitoring service is kind of DBaaS where my aim is 
to monitor, notify crashes and other useful works which can help the clients
to avoid manual control over its systems.

Purpose of this documentation is to disclose the moto of this service and how
its solves some pain points even with some existing services. Also it tells 
about how this works, its internal design, architecture, etc.
