Database Monitoring Service - Client Side

This documentation outlines a monitoring service tailored for **Redis** and other **in-memory databases**. Designed as a lightweight **Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)** solution, the primary objective of this service is to provide real-time monitoring, intelligent crash detection, and proactive notifications. The goal is to reduce the need for manual intervention and enhance the reliability and performance of client systems.

## Purpose

The core purpose of this service is to automate oversight and health-checks of in-memory databases, addressing common operational pain points often overlooked by existing solutions. By focusing on **simplicity**, **speed**, and **smart alerting**, this service aims to:

- Minimize downtime through early detection and alerting of crashes or unusual behavior  
- Provide actionable insights to improve system reliability  
- Reduce the operational overhead of database management  

## What This Documentation Covers

This document includes a comprehensive overview of the system, detailing:

- The motivation behind the project  
- Key features and differentiators compared to existing tools  
- System architecture and internal design  
- How the monitoring, alerting, and recovery mechanisms work  

This monitoring service is intended for teams looking for an efficient, **developer-friendly** alternative to complex DB monitoring platforms â€” especially when working with **Redis** or similar **high-performance in-memory data stores**.

## System Architecture
